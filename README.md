## Introduction
This package provides a flexible filesystem abstraction. It contains drivers for working with various filesystems with ease. It is super easy to switch between the disks as the API remains the same for each system.

---

## Installation

```python
#Using NPM
npm i @squareboat/nest-storage

#Using YARN
yarn add @squareboat/nest-storage
```
---
## Getting Started

To register `StorageModule` with your app, import the module inside `AppModule`. 

#### Static Registration

> `StorageModule` is added to global scope by default.

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { StorageModule } from '@squareboat/nest-storage'

@Module({
  imports: [
    StorageModule.register({
      default: 'docs',
      disks: {
        docs: {
          driver: 's3',
          bucket: 'docs',
          key: 'xxxxxx',
          secret: 'xxxxxxx',
          region: 'us-east-1'
        }
      }
    })
  ],
  controllers: [],
  providers: [],
})
export class AppModule { }
```

#### Recommended Way
Use `ConfigModule` provided by NestJS to load configurations. To learn about `ConfigModule`, [click here](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration).

**#1. Create filesystem.ts file**
```typescript
import { registerAs } from '@nestjs/config';
export default registerAs('filesystem', () => ({
  default: 'docs',
  disks: {
    docs: {
      driver: 's3',
      bucket: process.env.AWS_S3_DOCS_BUCKET,
      key: process.env.AWS_KEY,
      secret: process.env.AWS_SECRET,
      region: process.env.AWS_REGION,
    }
  }})
);
```

**#2. Register ConfigModule**
```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import filesystem from '@config/fileystem';
import { ConfigModule } from '@nestjs/config';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ConfigModule.forRoot({
      isGlobal: true,
      expandVariables: true,
      load: [filesystem],
    }),
  ],
  controllers: [],
  providers: [],
})
export class AppModule { }
```

**#3. Register Async StorageModule**
Add following snippet to the `imports` array. `ConfigService` is importable from `@nestjs/config` module.

```typescript
StorageModule.registerAsync({
  imports: [ConfigService],
  useFactory: (config: ConfigService) => {
    return config.get('filesystem')
  },
  inject: [ConfigService]
})
```

## Driver Configuration
The best part about this package is the simplicity that it provides while working across different storage providers. Every driver follow a simple and consistent API.

> Currently the package supports `AWS S3` filesystem. But we will be adding support of major Object Storage Solution Providers.

**Drivers in Pipeline:**
- Google Cloud Storage
- Firebase
- Digital Ocean

### **Amazon S3**

S3 is an higly scalable object storage solution provided by AWS. You can learn more about it [here](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

**Driver Name:** `s3`

**Configuration:**

```typescript
{
  driver: 's3',
  bucket: process.env.AWS_S3_DOCS_BUCKET,
  key: process.env.AWS_KEY,
  secret: process.env.AWS_SECRET,
  region: process.env.AWS_REGION,
}
```
`s3` driver expects four parameters to interact with an S3 bucket. You can get the `AWS_KEY`, `AWS_SECRET` by creating an api role user using IAM. Learn more about it [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_api).

### **Local**

You can use this package to manage the file objects stored locally on your system.

**Driver Name:** `local`

**Configuration:**
```typescript
{
  driver: 'local',
  basePath: '/home/ubuntu/var/www/your_project/storage', // fully qualified path of the folder
  baseUrl: 'https://example.com',
}
```

To serve the file objects from your project, have a look at [serve-static](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/serve-static) module by NestJS.

## Disks

We understand that while working on a big project, you may sometime encounter case where you will have to handle multiple type of files and filesystems at once.

While drivers help you to differentiate between the different storage strategies provided by each driver. Disks help you create logical distinctions between different types of storages.

**For example:** In ecommerce, you may want to handle the `invoices` and `products' pictures` differently. Via philosophy of disks we can easily implement it like following:

```typescript
import { registerAs } from '@nestjs/config';
export default registerAs('filesystem', () => ({
  default: 'docs',
  disks: {
    invoices: { // `invoices` disk, will contain the invoices of all the orders passed so far
      driver: 's3',
      bucket: process.env.AWS_S3_DOCS_BUCKET,
      key: process.env.AWS_KEY,
      secret: process.env.AWS_SECRET,
      region: process.env.AWS_REGION,
    },
    products: { // `products` disk, will contain photos of all the products
      driver: 's3',
      bucket: process.env.AWS_S3_PROFILE_PIC_BUCKET,
      key: process.env.AWS_KEY,
      secret: process.env.AWS_SECRET,
      region: process.env.AWS_REGION,
    },
    reports: {
      driver: 'local',
      basePath: '/home/ubuntu/var/www/your_project/storage', // fully qualified path of the folder
      baseUrl: 'https://example.com',
    }
  }})
);
```
Here we have created two different logical partitioning of `invoices`, `products`, `reports` disk without trashing our code üòé.

To switch between the different disks, it is as simple as:

**To access `invoices` disk:**
```typescript
import { Storage } from '@squareboat/nest-storage'

Storage.disk('invoices') // uses the `invoices` disk mentioned in above steps
```

**To access `products` disk:**
```typescript
import { Storage } from '@squareboat/nest-storage'

Storage.disk('products') // uses the `products` disk 
```

## Usage

This package provides a single and uniform API for any type of operation across different drivers and disks.
#### Methods
- `put(path: string, fileContent: any): Promise<StorageDriver$PutFileResponse>`: Put the file at the specified path.

- `get(path: string): Promise<Buffer | null>`: Get the file stored at the specified path.
 
- `exists(path: string): Promise<boolean>`: Check if file exists at the specified path.

- `missing(path: string): Promise<boolean>`: Check if file is missing at the specified path.

- `url(path: string): string`: Get the url for the specified path.

- `signedUrl(path: string, expire: number):Promise<string>`: Get a signed url to privately access the file stored at the specified `path`. Learn more about it [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html). Currently works for `s3` only.

- `meta(path: string): Promise<StorageDriver$FileMetadataResponse>`: Get file's metadata at the specified path.

- `delete(path: string): Promise<boolean>`: Delete file at the specified path.

- `copy(path: string, newPath: string): Promise<StorageDriver$RenameFileResponse>`: Copy file from path to newPath.

- `move(path: string, newPath: string): Promise<StorageDriver$RenameFileResponse>`: Move the file from path to newPath.

- `getClient()`: Get the underlying client of the disk. Currently works for `s3` only.
